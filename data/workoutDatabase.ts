Auto-Compare Drafts ‚Üí Side-by-side view of ‚ÄúAI Draft vs Trainer Edits‚Äù. Trainer can approve or revert changes with one click.

‚úÖ Saves trainer time, boosts trust.

3. Progression Engine

AI automatically builds Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2 ‚Üí Phase 3 (e.g., beginner ‚Üí intermediate ‚Üí advanced blocks).

Trainer only tweaks progression (like ‚Äúincrease intensity 10%‚Äù or ‚Äúswap cardio type‚Äù).

‚úÖ Long-term plan clarity for client.

4. Trainer Notes & Client Education

Final report has a trainer‚Äôs personal note auto-generated but editable:
‚ÄúHi (name of user), I‚Äôve personally reviewed your AI-based assessment. Here‚Äôs your tailored plan. I recommend focusing extra on recovery this week. Let‚Äôs crush it together üí™ ‚Äì Athul‚Äù

Client gets trust + human touch, not just raw AI.
